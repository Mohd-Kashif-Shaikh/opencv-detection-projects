🧠👁️ Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV  
📌 Project Overview

Built real-time face and eye detection systems using OpenCV and Haarcascade classifiers. Projects demonstrate the ability to detect facial features and live grayscale video capture through a webcam or video file input.

🧪 Algorithms / Techniques Used

- Haarcascade Classifier for:
  - Face Detection  
  - Eye Detection  
  - Full Body Detection  
- Grayscale Image Conversion  
- Frame-by-frame Video Analysis  

📈 Key Highlights

- Developed three separate detection systems:
  - Face Detection from prerecorded video (`walking.avi`)  
  - Real-time Face + Eye Detection using Haarcascades  
  - Live grayscale webcam feed with detection overlay  
- Utilized Haarcascade models for lightweight real-time performance  
- Used OpenCV to draw bounding boxes for detection results  
- Cleanly closed video windows using `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`  
- Easily expandable for mask detection, car detection, etc.
